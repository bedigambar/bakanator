# <u>BakaNator</u>
It is a Python-based guessing game inspired by **Akinator**, where the program attempts to figure out the object or substance you're thinking of through a series of questions.

Unlike traditional guessing games, SmartGuess is built to scale with large datasets and learn dynamically. If it can't guess correctly, it doesn't just fail, it learns from you, updates its knowledge base, and improves its accuracy over time.
